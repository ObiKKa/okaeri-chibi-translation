Oui!!
<1a0680010003>*Snap*!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Ho-ho-ho.<1a0680010002>
Ho-ho-ho.
On the contrary.

<1a0a8002000101010304>T- <1a078004000a00>This is<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>Just what is this?<1a0a8002000000000000>
<1a0680010003>I see!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>This is a<N>pro wrestler ring!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Oow-ow-ow!!<1a0680010002>
W- <1a078004000a00>Who are you guys?
Nice to meet you.
We're robots from<N>Citrusoft.
We're helping Jenny out<N>around the house<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>On the contrary!<1a0680010002>
Well, do you want to<N>become my pupils?
Aren't you interested?
That's what your eyes are<N>saying, isn't it?
<1a0680010003>Well then!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Then I'll teach you how to<N>become a pro wrestler!<1a0680010002>


Then I'll teach you how<N>to be a pro wrestler!
<1a0680010003><1a06ff000003>Habanero The Giant<N><1a06ff00000d> will teach you!<1a0680010002>
But first you need to<N>pay the <1a06ff000003>entrence fee<1a06ff00000d>.
It's been a while since I had a<N>pupil, so I'm a bit excited.

On the contrary.
Now then, it's only<N><1a06ff00000b>%d<1a06ff00000d> Moolah!
<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>O- <1a078004000a00>Okay.<N>I- <1a078004000a00><1a068000000a>I might have exaggerated.<1a0680000003>
How about an entrence campaign.<N>Will <1a06ff00000b>%d<1a06ff00000d> Moolah be fine?
<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>But,<N>You don't even have that.
You're just a bother, go away.
What?<N>You don't have it?
If you have something to say<N>then don't enter the ring.
It's basic manners.

What's that, Chibi-Robo?
Let's go check it out!

Hm<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>?
<1a068000000a>That guy...<N>Perhaps <1a078004000a00>he's...?<1a0680000003>
T-<1a078004000a00> T- <1a078004000a00>T-<1a078004000a00><1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>The real deal!?<1a0680010002>




I thought you would pay with<N>Bottle Caps or something.
<1a0680010003>On the contrary!<N>I like that!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Well then!<1a0680010002><N>I'll show you my special<1a0680000014>...<1a0680000003>
When I get excited,<N><1a068000000a><1a0680010001>I get hungry.<1a0680010002><1a0680000003>
<1a0680010001>I haven't eaten anything<N>but 8 tomatoes this morning.<1a0680010002>
<1a0680000000><1a06ff000003>*Pling*<1a0680000003>

Furthermore,<N>I need <1a06ff000005>2<1a06ff00000d> of them!
You can <1a068000000a>find some, right〜?<1a0680000003>

There we go. <1a078004000500>It's done.
I'll give you the<N>first one as a reward!
Here!<N>It's a <1a06ff000009>Spicy Tomato<1a06ff00000d>.
Uh-oh!
Don't give it to that<N><1a06ff000003>shark<1a06ff00000d> though.
She said she loved tomatoes so<N>I gave her a spicy tomato.
<1a0680010003>SPICY〜!<1a0680010002>
Was what she said... While<N>rampaging around.
It wasn't my fault<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
It makes me sick!
Anyways!
Don't give it to her!
Uh-oh!
But I don't care<N>about that shark anyway.
I'll just munch right in.
<1a0680010003>THIS IS IT!!<1a0680010002>
Gross and spicy is the<N>absolute best tag-team!
If I want more of them,<N>I'll just make them myself.
<1a0680010003>Well then!<1a0680010002><N>That made psyched up!
I'll teach you<N>my <1a06ff000003>special skill<1a06ff00000d>!
<1a0680010003>Well then,<N>let's start!<1a0680010002>
When facing your enemy<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>Do this!!<1a0680010002>

<1a0680000014>*Puh*... <1a078004000a00>*Puh*... <1a078004000a00>*Puh*...<1a0680000003><N>That made me a bit tired.
<1a068000000a>I'll pardon you for today.<1a0680000003>
Well then!<N>Try it out you too!
<1a0680010003>Now!<1a0680010002>
It doesn't look like your<N>close to being fast enough.
<1a0680010003>Well then!<1a0680010002><N>It's time for more training.
By looking at you I can say that<N>you don't have enough power.
So use that <1a06ff000003>dumbbell<1a06ff00000d>!
W-<1a078004000a00> Well I guess they're very...
The humans<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003> Well<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>They are much stronger.
We're better of focusing<N>on things that's our size.
Yeah, right<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>Anyways, get <1a06ff000005>3<1a06ff00000d> of those!
Find them in the room<N>and bring them to me.

I'll keep a watch on you<N>so you don't slack away!

Oh! <1a078004000a00>That's it.<N>That looks just fine.
Just get <1a06ff000003>%d<1a06ff00000d> more of those.

Oh,<1a078004000a00> you were faster<N>than I expected.
<1a0680010003>Well then!<1a0680010002><N>Let's begin immediately!
Are you ready?
That guy<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>Well, <1a078004000a00>that<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
No need to worry about the details!<N>Now! <1a078004000a00>Just do it!
<1a06ff000004>Slide down!
<1a0a8002000103030203><1a0680010003><1a06ff000003>%d!<1a0680010002><1a0a8002000000000000>
Damn... <1a078004001400>I've gotten<N>so out of shape<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Is this really me? Like the<N>one I was a long time ago...
<1a0680010003>A Star Wrestler<1a0680010002>.<N>What happened?
Furthermore, <1a078004000a00>I was a pro<N>wrestler on the Back Roof.
Actually, I was<N><1a0680010003>The Champion<1a0680010002>.
If only I hadn't<N>injured my ankle<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
I was really incredible<N>back in the days.
<1a0680010003>*Hngggh*〜<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Way〜 <1a078004000a00>TOO COOL!!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Doctor Habanero!<N>I didn't recoginze you!<1a0680010002>

The doctor is a genious!<N>The doctor is popular!
The doctor has long legs!
The doctor is the strongest!
For the sake of the doctor...
Keith <1a078004000a00>would also become<N>a good wrestler.
<1a068000000a>That was what I<N>thought at least.<1a0680000003>
Look, <1a078004000a00>over there.
I got a injured a little...<N>And now he's into soccer<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>Uh-oh!<1a0680010002><1a078004000a00><N>It's not like me!
Hey, <1a078004000a00>pupil!
Show me the results<N><1a0680010003>of your training!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Now!<1a0680010002>
Huh?<N>Isn't that weird?
<1a0680010001>The training was perfect.<N>The <1a06ff000009>Wrestler Outfit<1a06ff00000d> too<1a0680000014>...<1a0680000003><1a0680010002>

Put that on.
It's an ultra-super<N><1a0680010003>POWER-UP!!<1a0680010002>
Well then!<N>Hurry up and try it out!

Are you finished?
Ho-ho!<N>You got some strong points!
Well then!<N>Knock over various books...
Keep on training!
Keep on going<N>until the end.
Aren't you a hard worker.
That's <1a078004000a00> good〜
You've got some muscle!
Just like that!
Where are you going?
We're training right now!

Ho?<1a078004000a00> You got curious<N>about my sauce?
That sauce...
Whatever you dip into it, will<N>become <1a06ff000003>bright red and spicy!
It's a magic sauce!
For example, <1a078004000a00> a green tomato will<N>become a bright red tomato.
<1a06ff000004>There's some bright red sauce.
<1a06ff000004>Make a <1a06ff000009>Spicy Tomato<1a06ff000004>?
*Plump*
「<1a06ff000009>Spicy Tomato<1a06ff00000d>」

<1a0680010003><1a0680000000>Shut up!<N>You're noisy!<1a0680000003><1a0680010002>
