Hurry! Hurry!<N>Climb up the table!
Hurry! Hurry!<N>Climb up the table!
Let's hurry up and begin.
Hurry! Hurry!!
Try using the Chibi-Tools.
Quickly, I want to see.
It can collect Trash even<N>if it's this small, right!
Quickly, I want to see<N>Habanero's fight on TV!
You too right, Chibi?

<1a0680010003>Space rocket!<N>Space rocket!<1a0680010002>
We should have a space rocket as<N>the next thing to save up for.
We're not partners.
Somehow a nice thing!<N>Somehow a nice thing!

You too Chibi,<N>let's wish togetherã€œ
<1a0680010003>Stove!<N>Stove!<1a0680010002>

Hey, Keith!


<1a0680010003>Space rocket!<N>Space rocket!<1a0680010002>

Chibi<1a0680000014>...<N><1a0680000003>It goes beyond reality.
<1a0680010003>Shower!<N>Shower!<1a0680010002>
I'm finally free from mom's<N>depressing mood.
Hey, Keith! Isn't it<N>Lucky who's the stinky one!

<1a068000000a>Chiibiiiii.
Huh<1a068000000a>...

<1a0a8002000102020304><1a0680010003>Habanero is<N>so cool!<1a0680010002><1a0a8002000000000000>
No matter how many times I watch<N>this match, it's still awesome!
I sooo want a Habanero T-shirt.
But since we're poor, I'll<N>have to do without one.
Calm down Chibi.
As expected from a<N>space rocket, huh!
Huh? Wasn't it you who<N>bought the rocket, Chibi?
That's frickin' dangerous.

<1a0680010003>Chibi!
Did that room<N>change on it's own!?
Awesome, I liked that.
Huh? Is it wrong?



There's no way I can throw it!
I bought it with my hard<N>earned Moolah after all.
This room is frickin' bad.
There's a wharf!
Take a look at the<N>Habanero match.
It's just reruns.
In any case, we're poor!
Say, Chibi.<N>Do I stink?
Really? Maybe even<N>Lucky smells better<1a068000000a>...
Really? Lucky probably<N>stinks a whole lot too.
But it's such a bother<N>to take a shower!
Hehehe. Chibi.<N>I don't smell, right!?
But since your a robot, you don't<N>have a nose to smell with.
Come to think of it.<N>The army dolls aren't here<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Mom told me that if I don't put my<N>toys when I'm done playing...
Then she'll throw them away.
Sleep peacefully<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
